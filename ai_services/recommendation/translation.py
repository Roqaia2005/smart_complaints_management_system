translation.py
==============
Detects Arabic text and translates it to English using Groq.
Called once at the start of the pipeline before any analysis.

Why Groq and not a separate translation API?
- Already in the stack, no extra API key needed
- Handles Arabic very well
- Batch processing keeps API calls minimal
